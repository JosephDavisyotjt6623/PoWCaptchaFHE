# PoWCaptchaFHE

**PoWCaptchaFHE** is a next-generation privacy-preserving CAPTCHA system that leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to implement lightweight, encrypted proof-of-work challenges. This system is designed to protect user privacy while resisting automated attacks and minimizing friction for legitimate users.

## Project Background

CAPTCHAs are commonly used to distinguish humans from bots, but traditional approaches face several challenges:

- **Privacy concerns:** Many CAPTCHAs collect behavioral data or device information, potentially exposing user activity.  
- **Automated attacks:** Large-scale bots can bypass conventional CAPTCHAs, undermining security.  
- **User friction:** Solving visual or interactive CAPTCHAs can be inconvenient, reducing usability.  
- **Centralized verification:** Traditional CAPTCHAs require server-side validation, risking data exposure.

**PoWCaptchaFHE addresses these issues** by moving the computation client-side and performing encrypted proof-of-work, keeping sensitive information confidential while transferring the verification cost to the potential attacker.

## Core Concepts

- **Encrypted Proof-of-Work:** Users solve a small FHE-encrypted challenge linked to their device.  
- **Client-Side Computation:** Challenges are computed locally, preserving privacy and reducing server load.  
- **Bot Resistance:** The system forces attackers to expend computational resources, slowing large-scale automated attempts.  
- **Privacy-Preserving Verification:** The server validates results without accessing sensitive user data.
